;; This contract is a slight improvement from nameserver1.
;; We have added the ability to let the name 'owner' transfer
;; ownership by passing in the address of the new owner - LLL

;; input: tx.data[0] = name, tx.data[1] = name data, tx.data[2] = new owner (optional)
;; stores: key: name, value: [owner address (or new owner), name data]
